<h1>About this Repo</h1>
This repo is intended to centralized our dev version of WP for the Wyoming Tobacco data site.  This git can be cloned to desktop or you can download and make changes directly to the 'dev' branch.
<h2>Master</h2>
The dev branch is a copy of everything in the Master branch, which is nothing more than the basic WP installation.  We should just make changes within the dev branch, but can have any many branches off of dev as we need.
<h1>Tools</h1>
As detailed in Freedcamp, there are a lot of tools to version contral WP development.
I, Jessica, am using a combination of GitHub App for Mac and Desktop Server from serverpress.com. 
<h2>Desktop Server</h2>
I downloaded this software, created a localized server to run WP and then used the Github app to push/commit/version control the changes I've made.  Changes can be made in the regular WP, in-browser CMS or using GitHub directly.
